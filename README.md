# RomanNumeralProject

This project is a number converter that is used to convert Roman Numeral into Arabic digits.
The converter also has the capabilities to convert Arabic digits into Roman Numerals.
To do this the converter will first check the inputted value to see whether it is valid or not.
Along with this it checks if the inputted value is a Roman Numeral, if it is it then calls the numeral to int function which converts the numeral.
If the inputted value is not a numeral it is then converted over to one using the int to numeral function.
These values are outputted and shown on Javafx.

Prerequisite to run:
To run the project you must have Javafx and its plugins fully functioning.

Tests:
There are too main type of tests for the converter.
These tests are divided into the int to numeral tests and the numeral to int tests.
Other than these tests there are several extremes being tested for which include tests for 0, empty strings, and negative numbers.

The reason behind these tests is very straight forward for the most part.
To starts with we tested for the extremes such as large numbers, small numbers, 0, negatives, and empty strings.
following this we created the tests for more common numbers that a user would input into the system.
